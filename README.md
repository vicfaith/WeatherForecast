From the UI perspective, this app is almost same as my previous Forecast.io app but this app has been refactored to use MVVM architecture.

I have searched many blogs and github projects which implement MVVM patterns as follows and learned best pratices about MVVM.

My aim through this sample app is to build a kind of skeleton app which has latest technology trends and architecture.
